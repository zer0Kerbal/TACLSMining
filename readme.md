To install this simpl put the folder "TACLSMining" into gamedata.

This mod requires TACLS for it to function.

It modifies the stock ISRU so you can mine water, oxygen, oxygen and liquid fuel, plus waste resources.

PS> I would suggest you also download MunSeeker Mk1 Greenhouse on the KSP forums so you can grow food. The mod is designed to mine waste resources for the MunSeeker Mk1 Greenhouse so you can grow food off world. Also 'biomass' option in ISRU is waste. I just didn't want to call it waste but biomass is waste.
